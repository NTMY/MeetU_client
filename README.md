Hi,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm walfud. Nice to meet you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and I recently write an interesting APP, which comes from a wonderful idea --- **We don't want to miss our friends when passing by~** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have the same experience that *on a sunny weekend you just do shopping in the central mall, you find an old friend in surprise! "Oh~ rena, you're here! bla... bla..."*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we often miss ourselves in big city. We're busy in working, in going our way, in shopping, etc. The building divided each of us into seperated one. We have little and little time to meet our friend, which gave our many precious memory. Now, let's find the old-new friend in real world.
