Hi,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm walfud. Nice to meet you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend and I recently write an interesting APP, which comes from a wonderful idea --- **We don't want to miss our friends when passing by~** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have the same experience that *on a sunny weekend you just do shopping in the central mall, you find an old friend in surprise! "Oh~ rena, you're here! bla... bla..."*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we often miss ourselves in big city. We're busy in working, in going our way, in shopping, etc. The building divided each of us into seperated one. We have little and little time to meet our friend, which gave our many precious memory. Now, let's find the old-new friend in real world.

## Usage
---
1. Just to register a new user
![login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NTMY/MeetU_client/master/doc/login.png)
When you have **done the information**, then **click the icon to finish** the register. A new world is open to you.

2. Now you enter the simple mainboard, like follow:

	Besides, it's also an editor page:

	b) Normally, I'll search nearby friend automatically. You can also search friend by hand, just click the button(magnifying glass).
	
	If someone nearby(about 2km in real), it will show the friend(s) in the mainboard, at the same time it sends a notification to you. Like below:

	c) There are some preferences you can configure, now we have to item: first one is for gathering your location per 1 minute, this is immutable now since our restriction. The second is automatically search nearby friend and report it to you. Just turn it off if you don't want to be disturbed.
